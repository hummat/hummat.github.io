# Welcome to the blog repo of [Matthias Humt](https://hummat.com)!

This branch (`main`) is a barebones template for forking—no posts, just the skeleton. See it live at [hummat.github.io](https://hummat.github.io).

The full blog with all posts lives at [hummat.com](https://hummat.com).

## Roadmap

See the [Blog Roadmap](https://github.com/users/hummat/projects/2) project for planned features and content.
