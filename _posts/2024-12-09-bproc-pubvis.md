title: BlenderProc Publication Visualization
abstract: Visualizing data is my passion as you might have gathered from the content of this blog. Not having the time to make beautiful visualizations for a project or publication thus hurts all the more. I therefore decided to finally sit down for a couple of days and implement an easy-to-use tool that allows for the generation of publication-ready visualizations in seconds instead of hours. The result is BlenderProc Publication Visualization (bproc-pubvis), a Python package that allows for the generation of beautiful visualizations of 3D objects and point clouds in seconds instead of hours. Enjoy!
