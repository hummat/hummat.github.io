title: Combining Shape Completion and Grasp Prediction for Fast and Versatile Grasping with a Multi-Fingered Hand
abstract: We propose a pipeline combining shape completion from single depth images with grasp prediction for multi-fingered hands. Our system reconstructs object geometry and generates 1000 grasp candidates in approximately one second, enabling fast and versatile grasping of unknown objects.
