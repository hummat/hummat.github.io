title: PaperPipe
abstract: A CLI tool that maintains a local paper database with PDFs, LaTeX source, extracted equations, and coding-oriented summaries. Integrates with coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) so they can ground their responses in actual paper content rather than hallucinating implementation details.
