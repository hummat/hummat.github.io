title: Evaluating Latent Generative Paradigms for High-Fidelity 3D Shape Completion
abstract: We compare diffusion models and autoregressive transformers for reconstructing complete 3D shapes from partial depth images, showing that a diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both discriminative models and autoregressive approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion.
